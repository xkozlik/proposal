          <title>Background</title>
          <p>The SMC5-6 protein complex is involved in the cellular response to DNA damage. It is composed of 6–8 polypeptides, of which Nse1, Nse3 and Nse4 form a tight sub-complex. MAGEG1, the mammalian ortholog of Nse3, is the founding member of the MAGE (melanoma-associated antigen) protein family and Nse4 is related to the EID (E1A-like inhibitor of differentiation) family of transcriptional repressors.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
          <p>Using site-directed mutagenesis, protein-protein interaction analyses and molecular modelling, we have identified a conserved hydrophobic surface on the C-terminal domain of Nse3 that interacts with Nse4 and identified residues in its N-terminal domain that are essential for interaction with Nse1. We show that these interactions are conserved in the human orthologs. Furthermore, interaction of MAGEG1, the mammalian ortholog of Nse3, with NSE4b, one of the mammalian orthologs of Nse4, results in transcriptional co-activation of the nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1). In an examination of the evolutionary conservation of the Nse3-Nse4 interactions, we find that several MAGE proteins can interact with at least one of the NSE4/EID proteins.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
          <p>We have found that, despite the evolutionary diversification of the MAGE family, the characteristic hydrophobic surface shared by all MAGE proteins from yeast to humans mediates its binding to NSE4/EID proteins. Our work provides new insights into the interactions, evolution and functions of the enigmatic MAGE proteins.</p>

  abstract =   "Focus+context techniques provide visual guidance in
               visualizations by giving strong visual prominence to
               elements of interest while the context is suppressed.
               However, finding a visual feature to enhance for the focus
               to pop out from its context in a large dynamic scene, while
               leading to minimal visual deformation and subjective
               disturbance, is challenging. This paper proposes Attractive
               Flicker, a novel technique for visual guidance in dynamic
               narrative visualizations. We first show that flicker is a
               strong visual attractor in the entire visual field, without
               distorting, suppressing, or adding any scene elements. The
               novel aspect of our Attractive Flicker technique is that it
               consists of two signal stages: The first “orientation
               stage” is a short but intensive flicker stimulus to
               attract the attention to elements of interest. Subsequently,
               the intensive flicker is reduced to a minimally disturbing
               luminance oscillation (“engagement stage”) as visual
               support to keep track of the focus elements. To find a good
               trade-off between attraction effectiveness and subjective
               annoyance caused by flicker, we conducted two perceptual
               studies to find suitable signal parameters. We showcase
               Attractive Flicker with the parameters obtained from the
               perceptual statistics in a study of molecular interactions.
               With Attractive Flicker, users were able to easily follow
               the narrative of the visualization on a large display, while
               the flickering of focus elements was not disturbing when
               observing the context.",

  abstract =   "Background: Research in cell biology is steadily
               contributing new knowledge about many aspects of
               physiological  processes, both with respect to the involved
               molecular structures as well as their related function.  
               llustrations of the spatio-temporal development of such
               processes are not only used in biomedical education, but
               also can serve scientists as an additional platform for
               in-silico experiments.  Results: In this paper, we
               contribute a new, three-level modeling approach to
               illustrate physiological processes from the class of
               polymerization at different time scales. We integrate
               physical and empirical modeling, according to which approach
               best suits the different involved levels of detail, and we
               additionally enable a form of interactive steering, while
               the process is illustrated. We demonstrate the suitability
               of our approach in the context of several polymerization
               processes and report from a first evaluation with domain
               experts.  Conclusion: We conclude that our approach provides
               a new, hybrid modeling approach for illustrating the process
               of emergence in physiology, embedded in a densely filled
               environment. Our approach of a complementary fusion of three
               systems combines the strong points from the different
               modeling approaches and is capable to bridge different
               spatial and temporal scales.",

abstract = {{Molecular simulation is an extremely useful, but computationally very expensive tool for studies of chemical and biomolecular systems. Here, we present a new implementation of our molecular simulation toolkit GROMACS which now both achieves extremely high performance on single processors from algorithmic optimizations and hand-coded routines and simultaneously scales very well on parallel machines. The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program, Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest numbers of standard cluster nodes.}},
